# RetailSalesPortfolioProject
this is my another data analyst portfolio project.

This dataset is a snapshot of a fictional retail landscape, capturing essential attributes that drive retail operations and customer interactions. It includes key details such as Transaction ID, Date, Customer ID, Gender, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price per Unit, and Total Amount. These attributes enable a multifaceted exploration of sales trends, demographic influences, and purchasing behaviors.

The tools that I use in this project are Microsoft Excel, MySQL, and Tableau.
